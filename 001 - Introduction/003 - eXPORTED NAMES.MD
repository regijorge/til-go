# Exported names

In Go a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with capital letter so they are not exported.

When importing a package you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(math.Pi) // math.pi is not accessible outside the package
}
``
